After more than 2 years and 30+ blog posts, I am proud to announce [reactjunkie.com](https://reactjunkie.com)
has finally moved to [Gatsby](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/). It's been an incredible journey and Gatsby is an incredible 
app. It's only fitting that a website about react is built on react! In this post, I'll talk about my experience
moving an existing site to gatsbyjs.    

## Previously
I was using an open source Jekyll theme called [indigo](https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo). It supports hot-reload,
code highlighting, easy config, looks really good and it's very fast. In some ways this template was ahead of its time.
Hot reload 2 years ago was still in its infancy in the js world! Thank you [Sergio A.Kopplin](https://github.com/sergiokopplin)
for your hard work making this theme.
 
## Gatsby is not a good idea
I must admit initially I wasn't convinced that moving to Gatsby is a good idea. Firstly it's like starting a new project.
You are designing a website and implementing it in react. This takes time and time I don't have. I am already maintaining about
7 or 8 open source projects and I still have a blog to update.

Secondly what benefits do I gain moving to Gatsby? Indigo is already giving me hot reload, it looks good and is really fast. Do
I have to move? This is a common developer mentality.
 
> "If it ain't broke don't fix it" 

Lastly, is it an overkill? It's just a static blog site, does it really need to be on the bleeding edge frontend engineering?

## Gatsby _is_ a great idea 
Yes the initial bootstrap to start a new project is time consuming but it's definitely worth it beyond any doubt. 
The ecosystem is soo good! Markdown support is first class through [gatsby-transformer-remark](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-transformer-remark/).
You query almost anything you need about your post through graphql! I didn't think you could use graphql this way, so
it's pretty innovative. You can cut down the design time by "mimicking" some of the existing blog sites. I must admit
I get a lot of inspiration from medium.

Secondly benefits? Loads! You get a spa with kick-ass performance and a world class development experience; live-reload, linting,
prettier, testing. You don't just get benefits, you get an entirely different realm of experience. To hammer the nail home,
there's a plugin for pretty much anything you need like youtube support, syntax highlighting, styled components, etc.

Lastly is it an overkill? It is just a static blog site but there's definitely a lot of room for improvement. As frontend 
engineers, we should embrace progress because that's how we learn and improve. Gatsby is one such progress and I'm so glad
I embraced it.
